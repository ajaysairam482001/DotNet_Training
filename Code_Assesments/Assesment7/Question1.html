        <h1 style="text-align:center">Dihydrogen Monoxide</h1>
        <b>Dihydrogen monoxide</b> , also known as <i>hydroxyl acid or DHMO </i>
        ,is a <b>dangerous substance </b>that
        is the major component of acid rain,<br />
        contributes to the greenhouse effect, may cause severe burns, is fatal if inhaled, <br />
        contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape, <br /> accelerates corrosion
        and rusting of many metals, <br /> may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes,<br />
        and has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.
<p>
    Despite the danger,
    DHMO is often used: as an industrial solvent and coolant, in nuclear power plants in the production of Styrofoam<sup>TM</sup>,
    as a fire retardant, in many forms of cruel animal research, as an additive in certain junk-foods
    and other food products, in the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.
    <sup>1</sup>The more common chemical formula is H<sub>2</sub>O.
